# Scratch-drumming-game

I created a drumming brain training game. Push the green button and it will play a pattern. Then you repeat the same pattern by clicking the same sprites in the same order. Every time you get it correct you go one level up. 
You have three lives and in every level you are allowed to use 'Help' once. To do that, press 'h', or simply click the magical frog. 
When you set a new highscore, the magical frog will dance for you!

To initialize the game, click the green flag.

Have fun!
